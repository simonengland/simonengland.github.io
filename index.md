# Welcome

Hello, my name is Simon England. I'm an Identity and Access Management expert based near London.

## About Me

I hold a degree in Natural Sciences, specializing in nanophysics and geophysical science. I completed my masters project on slip and rupture velicty of rocks with high speed photography. My academic background has equipped me with a deep understanding of the natural world, from the smallest particles to geological processes.

Currently, I provide top-notch IAM services for City Electrical Factors (CEF). If you're curious to learn more about CEF, you can find them [here](https://www.cef.co.uk/).

In my spare time you'll either find me reading a book, preparing an extravagent feast, or hosting games nights with friends, strategizing my way to victory in a thrilling board game showdown, or bumbling around enthusiastically in a video game.
